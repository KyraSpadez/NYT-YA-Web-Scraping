# NYT-YA-Web-Scraping

## This project features a code I created using Python in Jupyter Notebook to web scrape Young Adult novels from the New York Times' bestsellers list. Its purpose is to list out the ranking, book title, author, and publisher. I scraped data from multiple web pages (separated as months on the NYT website) using a loop with BeautifulSoup. 

### Data retrieved from: https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2022/0{i}/01/young-adult-paperback-monthly/
** Replace {i} with month number **
